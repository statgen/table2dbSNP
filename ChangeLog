table2dbSNP Changes:

Change request from Tom Blackwell:

1:

Are you able to change 'table2dbSNP' for me so that it will take the SNP local
identifier from a column in the input ? At present, the code automatically
generates an identifier as it writes the "SNP:" line. 

2:

A second request, while you're looking at the code:  could we change the
condition for writing a "SNP_LINK:NCBI" line from:  "first two characters of
"display:" column match "rs", to:    "display:" column not equals "."


Further clarification from email Jun 27, 2011 (see
db.snp.submit.182.sample.tab):

Here's a very short excerpt from one of the tab delimited files I want to use
for dbSNP submission.  The "SNP_LINK" line should be written from the column
"display" when this is not ".".  (For my present purposes, I am writing "ss"
numbers rather than "rs" numbers in the "SNP_LINK" column.)

The "local_identifier" column supplies the <value> for the line
"SNP:<handle>|<value>".  (This is the first row in each dbSNP record.)  For
this submission I need to send to dbSNP exactly the same local identifiers I
have used in prior submissions.

The "#CHROM","loc","ref","alleles" columns should be read and processed as
before.  The "rsid","phase1.indiv","phase1.depth" and "pop.avg.allele.freq"
columns should produce extra rows in the "COMMENTS:" section of the dbSNP
record, just as the program currently does.

    Copy from old git repository, clean up a bit, make it work
    with new makefile.
